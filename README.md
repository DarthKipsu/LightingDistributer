LightingDistributer
===================

This program is designed to aid outdoor lighting designers with dividing columns over roads and highways.

The program is still pre alpha version.

### Features
* Custom road geometries, with straight sections and curves
* Curve radius factor for decreasing maximum column spacing in curves
* Restricted road sections to avoid placing columns on intersections etc.
* Easy to use user interface

### References
The column placing follows the instructions set by [Finnish Transport Agency](http://portal.liikennevirasto.fi/sivu/www/e/), but the program has not been developed in affiliation with them.
